\section{Interacting with the HOL4 REPL}

The HOL4 REPL is an extended version of the polyML~\cite{polymlweb} REPL, and
behaves like the REPL's of other interpreted languages.
After starting the HOL4 REPL, code is send with the keybinding \ekey{M-h r}.

For example, type
\begin{lstlisting}
  3 + 5;
\end{lstlisting}

anywhere in the current script file, highlight it with emacs highlighting
command (\ekey{C-space}, then arrow keys for marking) and send it to the REPL
with \ekey{M-h r}.

The REPL should print:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
> 3+5;
val it = 8: int
\end{lstlisting}

All of the functionality of the polyML REPL, and in general, the Standard ML
basis library (see e.g. \url{https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/} for a reference)
are available in the HOL4 REPL.
Thus HOL4 supports creating and manipulating lists, strings, options, and
simple I/O.

As a quick point of reference, \autoref{tbl:keybindings} gives a short,
executive summary of the most commonly used keybindings.
If you are not familiar with using emacs in general, we recommend the built-in
tutorial \ekey{C-h t}.

\begin{tabular}{@{}cll@{}}
  \toprule
  Keybinding & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Effect} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Remark}\\
  \midrule
  \ekey{M-h H} & Start a new HOL4 session & \\
  \ekey{M-h r} & Send marked text to REPL & \\
  \ekey{M-h g} & Start a new proof & Must be within a \texttt{Theorem}, \texttt{Proof} block\\
  \ekey{M-h e} & Applies a tactic & Marked SML code must have type `tactic`\\
  \ekey{M-h d} & Stop current interactive proof \\
